## To Run Unit Tests:
`python3 manage.py test`: run the unit tests in the command line.

## To Generate the Test Coverage Report:
1. Run Coverage: `coverage run manage.py test`.
2. Generate a coverage report: `coverage report -m` (generates a coverage report in the commandline).
3. Generate an HTML coverage report: coverage html: `coverage html` (report can be found in _htmlcov/index.html_ in project root directory).

## Possible Future Enhancements in the Project:
- Add user authentication for the APIs.
- Restrict 'employee monthly payment list' to user with accounts role (and admins) only.
- Containerize(using Docker) the project to avoid the infrastructure dependency.
